<h1>Readme.md for Temperature Game</h1> <p>This repository contains my solutions to the Temperature game on <a href="https://www.codingame.com/">CodinGame</a>. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my knowledge of algorithms and programming languages.</p> <h2>Game Description</h2> <p>The Temperature game is a puzzle game where you have to find the temperature closest to zero among a list of temperatures. You are given a list of temperatures and you have to output the temperature closest to zero. If two temperatures are equally close to zero, then the positive integer has to be returned (for example, between -5 and 5, the positive integer 5 has to be returned).</p> <h2>Repository Contents</h2> <p>This repository contains my solution to the Temperature game on CodinGame.
