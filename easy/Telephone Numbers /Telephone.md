<h1>Readme.md for Telephone Game</h1> <p>This repository contains my solutions to the Telephone game. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my knowledge of communication skills.</p> <h2>Game Description</h2> <p>The Telephone game is a communication game where a message is passed from one person to another through a series of whispers. The message is whispered from person to person until it reaches the final person, who then says the message out loud. The final message is often very different from the original message due to miscommunication and misunderstandings along the way.</p> <h2>Repository Contents</h2> <p>This repository does not contain any code or solutions.
